Some things that should be done at some order:

1. Add non-trivial weight.
2. Organize the files.
3. Apply orbit method in general, and not only for orthogonal over Q.
4. Compute Hecke eigensystems without computing the entire Hecke operator on the whole space.
5. Write unit tests.
6. Incorporate the symplectic case.
7. Understand how to work with GroupOfLieType (or, if not, devise some other method of describing the reductive group)
8. Think what should be done in general (other isogeny classes, central tori - how should everything work? maybe use the Tits algebra?)
